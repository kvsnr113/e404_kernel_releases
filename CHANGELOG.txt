• (NOVA R6) 2024/07/17 :
- Merged Linux v4.19.317 tag
- Merged July Google ASB tag
- Introduced per-cluster scheduler DVFS headroom to replace old boost method
- Adjusted devfreq boost base frequency to match DVFS headroom changes
- A lot of changes and optimization for kernel stability
- A lot of micro optimization under kernel scheduler and block
- Fixed freezing/force close issue for some users
- Further debloated kernel features and functions much more
- Shipped compiler with latest AOSP clang by Google
- Munch more, lazy to write. Check source for complete changelogs.

• (NOVA R5) 2024/07/01 :
- Any random reboot or freeze issue should be fixed now (except for HyperOS due to ximi skill issue lol)
- Heavily debloated debugging, tracing, logging, coresight and useless kernel features
- Heavily debloated munch dtbo overlay and dtb
- Kernel is now compact & clean asf
- Switched to uncompressed kernel image
- Booting time is now much faster due to compact size
- Major changes under kernel scheduler related stuff
- Reduced latency to enter idle time, also aggressively try to enter device into idle state
- Reset back and merge GPU drm/atomic changes to latest linux
- Implemented GPU busy scale tuning
- Fixed slow charging issue for some users and reworked charging drivers
- PD charger is now allowed to charge up to 30watt
- Kills wakelock faster for better deepsleep
- Improved kernel stability from compiler side
- Munch bunch more...
(!! HyperOS SUPPORT IS NOW DROPPED, !!)

- Fixed KernelSU 'pm', 'dexopt' and any other terminal command.
- Disabled Multi-Gen LRU by default due to some problematic rom, use this module to enable it.
- Revert back to 250hz kernel scheduler tick rate.
- Added & enabled BBR v2 TCP congestion algorithm.
- More adjustment to KProfile and boosting driver for better utilization.
- Stability improvement in kernel/math due to some compiler flags being reverted.
- Bumped GPU voltage by a bit to prevent artifacts for some users with bad silicone.
- Bumped KGSL GMU frequency.
- Munch More...
